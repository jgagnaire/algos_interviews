1 - a node is either red or black
2 - the root is always black
3 - the leaves are always black
4 - a red node always has two black children
5 - from a given node, any path to any of its descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes

the maximal height for a red black tree with N internal nodes is 2 log (N + 1)
