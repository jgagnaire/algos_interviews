Stable sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of records with equal keys (i.e. values).

That is, a sorting algorithm is stable if whenever there are two records R and S with the same key
and with R appearing before S in the original list, R will appear before S in the sorted list.


stable sorting algos:
-> bubble sort
-> bucket sort
-> counting sort (or countsort)
-> mergesort
-> radix sort

unstable sorting algos:
-> heapsort
-> quicksort
